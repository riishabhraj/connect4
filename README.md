# Connect4

Connect4 is a two-player strategy game in which players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The objective is to connect four of their own discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before their opponent does. This web-based version includes real-time multiplayer functionality using WebSockets, allowing two players to compete interactively over the web, with synchronized gameplay and turn-based mechanics.
